                <p>An overlay, according to Naema Baskanderi, is an element that sits on top of an application’s main window. As such, it disables the main window (but keeps it visible) and the user must interact with the overlay for it to close.</p>

                <p>An overlay can be used for grabbing a user’s attention, getting user input, and showing additional information with or without context. Some mandatory features of an overlay include an escape route (cancel, exit, etc.), a descriptive title, a button, and a clear focus. An overlay should be the right size, and it is best if the overlay is triggered by the user’s actions.</p>

                <p>Avoid overlays on mobile – this is because of the small size of the mobile screen. If the overlay includes user input, the keyboard takes up even more screen space, making overlays very frustrating to use. </p>

                <p>We must consider accessibility. For general accessibility, consider users with low vision. Color contrast must be sufficient. For users that use screen magnifiers, the overlays will be zoomed in and may take up most of the screen, rendering them as frustrating as overlays on mobile. When developing an overlay, use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) tags.</p>

                <p>Finally, overlays are not always the best choice, as they interrupt user flow. Consider using the checklist Naema Baskanderi provided in her article to decide if an overlay is the most effective.</p>

                <h3>BEST PRACTICES FOR FORM DESIGN</h3>
                <div class="subhead">
                    <p id="top"><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">SOURCE</a></p>
                    <p id="bottom">AUTHOR: SALIM ANSARI</p>
                </div>

                <p>Reading this article by Salim Ansari was interesting, because a lot of the recommendations he provided were things that I was already including in my design. Perhaps it was a result of the fact that I was very familiar with Jakob Nielsen’s principles for UX design, perhaps it was because a lot of these recommendations were already intuitive. </p>

                <p>We’ve all had to fill plenty of web forms, and thanks to Google Forms, it is more than likely that we’ve designed and sent out forms ourselves. Keeping in mind the goal of simplicity and ease-of-design, the principles I think should be always implemented include starting with the least complicated option, action buttons, sizing of fields accordingly, and accessibility. </p>

                <p>Starting with the least complex option allows for user retention and conversion. Action buttons provide more context, reducing mental load on the user. Similarly, sizing of fields according to the size of their input also reduces mental load, as it lets users know how long the text entry is going to be. Consider an entry for a phone number and one for zip code. The zip code is typically 5-8 characters long, while a phone number is at least 9-10 characters long. Even if the user doesn’t read the labels properly, the size limit on the entry field allows them to figure out what goes where. Accessibility in web design is important, and UX designers have been designing for accessibility for many years now. However, it is now important to go beyond, and start designing for blind and/or deaf users as well.</p>

                <p>Example: I enjoy the checkout experience provided by Shopify. It uses almost all the principles discussed by Salim Ansari, and since many brands use Shopify, I almost always know what to expect. <a href="https://colourpop.com/13380845/checkouts/c186277d8b0c3f25ecbce942ac401ab3?_ga=2.76891350.294044685.1674969706-793976978.1664311308 ">Colourpop</a> uses the Shopify checkout experience. </p>
