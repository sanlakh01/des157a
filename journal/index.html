                <p>The game design UX article mostly discusses the design of mobile app games. Amir Dori discusses generally UX principles, and how they can apply to the design of mobile games. He also discusses dark UX designs and how they’re used in mobile games.</p>

                <p>An underlying principle to all designs for mobile games is ease-of-access on a screen. A screen can be divided into three areas: comfort-to-each, okay-to-reach, and hard-to-read. The rest of principles that Dori discusses is based on what is within easy reach and what is not. </p>

                <p>Reading about how rewarded videos are designed in mobile games was interesting, because I never thought about the conscious decisions there that had to be made by a UI designer – I’d always thought that it was some type of business decision only.</p>

                    <figcaption>Fig.1 Desktop screenshot. Daniel Ramos, 2023</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>This image has tons of layers, it is very interesting. Clearly, the image is a screenshot of a desktop at a SCC classroom, possibly of someone in the middle of a task. It has Chrome open on a Google Doc titled "Image thing”. This doc is zoomed in to center on a pixel-art image of a character who has three red buttons in front of them, with a video-game style dialogue box saying “Choose wisely!”. Chrome has 9 other tabs open and reading the titles on the tab it looks like Daniel took this screenshot while working on an assignment for this class. </p>

                <p>There are 2 windows of Visual Studio Code open, one to the right of the Chrome window, and one mostly hidden behind both windows. The VSC window to the right has two files open, both related to a class exercise on mouse interactions in JavaScript. The VSC window that is mostly hidden has 4 pending changes on the source control icon, so I think this window is the main working directory for our portal page. </p>

                <p>The most obvious aspect of this image are the contents – they mostly tell a complete story (at least, to me they do). What I find most mysterious is <i>why</i> this image was chosen for Daniel’s collection, and subsequently what the collection is about. </p>

                </figure>

                <p>The image I chose is going to be the main hero image of my Every Picture project. The image features a selection of jewelry on a jewelry stand, with notebooks, candles and miscellaneous skincare and makeup products scattered across a desk. </p>

                <p>This image contains all of my collection items in it and is the primary image viewers will interact with to find the details of my collection. My collection specifically is of moon earrings, of which I picked the 5 most interesting and photographed. I have been collecting earrings since I was 6 years old, and jewelry brings me great joy. As I was going through my collection, I found that I had ended up collecting quite a few moon earrings – why, I could not tell you. At this point, you may be wondering why the moon since it is featured everywhere in this website. The answer is quite simple – I like the moon. </p>

                <p>What you wouldn't know just by looking at the image: Everything in the picture (apart from my 5 earrings) belongs to my roommate, who saw me taking pictures and wanted me to use her objects to create an aesthetically messy picture. Thanks Sofie!</p>

                <p>I found it very interesting that visual thinking was a recommended learning technique, as I often use it to entertain myself when bored. It is very fun to just closely examine a picture to find all the little details and “easter eggs” that may be hidden in there. </p>

                <p>According to some of the teachers on this New York Times article, this helped their students hone their critical thinking skills and to also practice their language skills. </p>

                <p>Like any other skill, visual thinking requires constant practice. Some teachers did these exercises on a weekly basis. They encouraged their students to engage with the picture and come up with suggestions by asking open ended questions, and by allowing them to build on each other’s answers. </p>

                <p>With visual thinking (“guess what’s going on in the picture”), the foundations for critical thinking, collaborative work, and a wider understanding of the “bigger picture.”</p>

                <p>From the Awwwards website, I found the online store of jewelry brand <a href="https://obeydelay.com/en">Delay</a>, which has an amazing loading/opening sequence.</p>

                <h3>BEST PRACTICES FOR MODALS/OVERLAYS/DIALOG WINDOWS</h3>
                <div class="subhead">
                    <p class="top"><a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">SOURCE</a></p>
                    <p class="bottom">AUTHOR: NAEMA BASKERANDI</p>
                </div>

                <p>An overlay, according to Naema Baskanderi, is an element that sits on top of an application’s main window. As such, it disables the main window (but keeps it visible) and the user must interact with the overlay for it to close.</p>

                <p>An overlay can be used for grabbing a user’s attention, getting user input, and showing additional information with or without context. Some mandatory features of an overlay include an escape route (cancel, exit, etc.), a descriptive title, a button, and a clear focus. An overlay should be the right size, and it is best if the overlay is triggered by the user’s actions.</p>

                <p>Avoid overlays on mobile – this is because of the small size of the mobile screen. If the overlay includes user input, the keyboard takes up even more screen space, making overlays very frustrating to use. </p>

                <p>We must consider accessibility. For general accessibility, consider users with low vision. Color contrast must be sufficient. For users that use screen magnifiers, the overlays will be zoomed in and may take up most of the screen, rendering them as frustrating as overlays on mobile. When developing an overlay, use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) tags.</p>

                <p>Finally, overlays are not always the best choice, as they interrupt user flow. Consider using the checklist Naema Baskanderi provided in her article to decide if an overlay is the most effective.</p>

                <h3>BEST PRACTICES FOR FORM DESIGN</h3>
                <div class="subhead">
                    <p class="top"><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">SOURCE</a></p>
                    <p class="bottom">AUTHOR: SALIM ANSARI</p>
                </div>

                <p>Reading this article by Salim Ansari was interesting, because a lot of the recommendations he provided were things that I was already including in my design. Perhaps it was a result of the fact that I was very familiar with Jakob Nielsen’s principles for UX design, perhaps it was because a lot of these recommendations were already intuitive. </p>

                <p>We’ve all had to fill plenty of web forms, and thanks to Google Forms, it is more than likely that we’ve designed and sent out forms ourselves. Keeping in mind the goal of simplicity and ease-of-design, the principles I think should be always implemented include starting with the least complicated option, action buttons, sizing of fields accordingly, and accessibility. </p>

                <p>Starting with the least complex option allows for user retention and conversion. Action buttons provide more context, reducing mental load on the user. Similarly, sizing of fields according to the size of their input also reduces mental load, as it lets users know how long the text entry is going to be. Consider an entry for a phone number and one for zip code. The zip code is typically 5-8 characters long, while a phone number is at least 9-10 characters long. Even if the user doesn’t read the labels properly, the size limit on the entry field allows them to figure out what goes where. Accessibility in web design is important, and UX designers have been designing for accessibility for many years now. However, it is now important to go beyond, and start designing for blind and/or deaf users as well.</p>

                <p>Example: I enjoy the checkout experience provided by Shopify. It uses almost all the principles discussed by Salim Ansari, and since many brands use Shopify, I almost always know what to expect. <a href="https://colourpop.com/13380845/checkouts/c186277d8b0c3f25ecbce942ac401ab3?_ga=2.76891350.294044685.1674969706-793976978.1664311308 ">Colourpop</a> uses the Shopify checkout experience. </p>
