            <h2>Zzz...</h2>
            <p>Zzz... is a simple game of chance, where you compete with another player to make sure you don‚Äôt wake your respective cat - cloud or mona - while finishing your last chore.</p>
            <p>A player is randomly chosen to start their chore, and their cat's name (cloud or mona) will then appear on top of the cat. When you hit the work button, you start to work on your chore and you will be accordingly assigned a score. This score tells you how close you were to waking your cat up at each step of the chore. You have 9 steps to complete the chore.</p>
            <p>If you receive the following scores - 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, or 99, you have disturbed your cat's nap, and they will peer grumpily at you. However, your cat is able to go back to sleep. However, you forfeit your turn as you have disturbed your cat's nap.</p>
            <p>If you receive the following scores - 1, 25, 50, 75, or 100, you have woken your cat up, and you have failed to successfully complete your chore. Consequently, you forfeit your turn and you have to start you chores all over again (reset).</p>
            <p>To win, the player with the least number of disturbances and failures wins, and is rewarded with a gently snoring cat.</p>
            <p>You can always click the "i" button on the top right to view these rules.</p>
            <p>Pressing Esc will close the overlay, but will NOT start the game. Click the button below to start the game.</p>
            <button>Ready? Let's play!</button>
