            <p>Once upon a time,  there was a tiny girl who only wanted to play with the stars in the sky. So on one fine night off she went to find them. And she walked and walked and walked, until she came by a river. “Good day to you,” says she, “I’m seeking the stars in the sky to play with. Have you seen any?”</p>
            <p>“Oh, yes,” said the river. “They shine in my face all night, until I can’t sleep because of them. Jump in and perhaps you’ll find one.” She jumped in, and swam and swam, but she couldn’t find a single one. So she went on till she came to a pond.</p>
            <p>“Good day to you, pond,” says she; “I’m seeking the stars in the sky to play with. Have you seen any?” “Yes, indeed, beautiful child,” said the pond. “They glint on my banks at night.” So she paddled and she paddled and she paddled, but never did she find one. So on she went till she came to the fae.</p>
            <p>“Good day to you, fae,” says she; “I’m looking for the stars in the sky to play with. Have you ever seen one?” “Why, yes, my beautiful child,” said the fae. “They shine on the grass here at night.” She danced and she danced and she danced, but never did she see one. So down she sat; I suppose she wept.</p>
            <p>“Oh dearie me, oh dearie me,” says she, “I’ve swam and I’ve paddled and I’ve danced, and if you’ll not help me I shall never find the stars in the sky to play with.” So the fae whispered together, and one of them came up to her and took her by the hand and said, “If you won’t go home to your mother, go forward, go forward; mind you take the right path.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, shall I be among the stars in the sky then?” cried the girl.</p>
            <p>“If you’ll not be there, then you’ll be elsewhere,” said the fae, and set to dancing again.</p>
            <p>So on she went again with a light heart, and she eventually came to a wide glistening path that went up into the sky. As she came to the start of the path, she saw - at the far end of it - shining things dancing about. </p>
            <p>And off she ran, most joyously, as she had found the stars to play with. And she played with the stars all night, until she could play no more. “Dear stars,” she cried, “will I get to play with you again?” And the shining things smiled and said, “For every night you sleep well, you will find the path to play with us.” And so the little girl falls asleep night after night, and she spends all her nights playing with her new, wonderful friends. </p>
