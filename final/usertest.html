            <h3>Heart Icon</h3>
            <p>My design has a heart icon on the top left corner, which was for decoration. However, all of my testers tried to click on the heart icon and later expressed a desire for it to lead to something related to my earring collection. Based on their feedback, I plan on having it lead to list of my favorite earring shops, and where to buy them.</p>

            <h3>Zoom Interaction</h3>
            <p>At the time of user testing, my code was not complete and the zoom interaction was not working correctly. The zoom interaction was moving, instead of zooming. As a result, all of my user testers thought that they needed to scroll horizontally to explore my webpage. To fix this, I asked Bill for help, and it turned out to be a specificity issue.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Instructional Overlay</h3>
            <p>All of my user testers found the overlay helpful, but they did not move to it immediately. All of them explored and clicked around first, and then found the overlay. One tester specifically mentioned that it may be useful to have appear immediately on load, while another said that they didn't really find it useful.</p>
