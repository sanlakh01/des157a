        <h1>design brief - every picture</h1>
        <p>to update the every picture studio, with more stylized images and a more efficient html and javascript page.</p>

            <h3>project goals</h3>
            <p>My main goal for the final is to make the code better. The code, as of now, just works. I would like it to work well, based on what I know. More specifically, I will be updating the scroll and the image zooming less jarring and abrupt. I will also have the overlays appear on a click, so that users can view the earring without any interruptions. When it comes to the design of the webpage itself, I want the image to fill up the browser window. Right now, it takes up a good portion of the window, but ideally I would like it to fill up the window.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>design strategies</h3>
            <p>The overall look will not be changing much. I plan on retaking the photos, staging the jewelry to fit the theme and look I want to go for. I want it to look slightly vintage, with vignette and grain. For the font and colors, I am happy with the existing color scheme and font families that I chose, so I will not be changing that. I will also edit the design of the pre-loader screen, and perhaps have an overlay with how to interact with my page.  Ultimately, I want my final website to look like an upgraded version of the current Every Picture assignment.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>interaction strategies</h3>
            <p>Like with design, I plan on upgrading my interaction elements, not just completely changing it. I will have the mouse-interaction zoom and the appearance of the overlays be separate, so that users can click to learn more information as they please. I will also have the zooms be slower and have the staring position be more in the center of the page so that the initial load and zoom isn’t as jarring as it currently is. For the overlays, I will have them appear and disappear with animation, and I may include time delays, depending on whether it impedes a smooth user flow or not. </p>

        <section>
            <h3>experience goals</h3>
            <p>With the current Every Picture, the user interaction is mostly smooth, but I’m not too sure if there enough clarity in what I expect my users to do. I plan on taking user feedback from peer reviews and from the user tests to better refine my design and make it as user friendly as possible. The big issue with interaction is the starting point of the image zoom, which is currently is the top left corner. It is also highly sensitive, so I want it to be less sensitive and make it so that users can pan around the earrings without jarring transitions. </p>
