        <p>I will be updating my Every Picture studio, with more stylized images, and with a more efficient HTML and JavaScript page.</p>

            <h3>Project Goals</h3>
            <p>My main goal for the final is to make the code better. The code, as of now, just works. I would like it to work well, based on what I know.</p>
            <p>More specifically, I will be updating the scroll and the image zooming less jarring and abrupt. I will also have the overlays appear on a click, so that users can view the earring without any interruptions.</p>
            <p>When it comes to the design of the webpage itself, I want the image to fill up the browser window. Right now, it takes up a good portion of the window, but ideally I would like it to fill up the window.</p>
