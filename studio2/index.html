                <p>These earrings are my favorite moon earrings. I bought these early 2022, from the Davis Street Market - this is from Amoeba Clay. I picked these up because I wanted green earrings, but they ended up starting my addiction to moon themed objects.</p>

                <p>These earrings are my only copper earrings. It has a long dangle, with a tiny crescent moon at the end. These were bought in 2022, from the Davis Street Market. I picked these up because I love the color of copper - it was a coincidence that they were moons.</p>

                <p>These earrings are my most unique earrings. I bought these in 2022 from the Beaded Planet, online. These are cuffs that go behind the ear. They are a mismatched pair, with a yellow-themed sun cuff and a purple-themed moon cuff.</p>

                <p>These earrings are my basic moon earrings. I bought these in 2022, from the Davis Street Market- I don't remember from whom. I picked these up because they are simple white dangles that aren't oversized, unlike my green pair.</p>

                <p>These earrings are part of a themed set. I bought these in 2022, from Etsy - they were one of my first clay earrings. I picked these up because I liked how unique the hardware was, and I liked the sun on top of the moon.</p>
